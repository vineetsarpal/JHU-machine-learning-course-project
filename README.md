## Introduction

In this report we will predict the manner in which a certain excercise is performed. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. We will create a report describing how we built your model, how we used cross validation, what we think the expected out of sample error is, and why we made the choices we did. At the end, we will also use our prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

## Data 
We will be using data from <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har> website. The dataset provides us with data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm and dumbbell of 6 participants. These participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
